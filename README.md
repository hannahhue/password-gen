## Description

The password generater I created can be used by anyone to generate a unique and stong password. Its simple but efficiant and quick. I created this by using tips from sources and utalizing variables and functions. My motivation to create this was to give a fast way to produyce reliable passwords so i can save time instead of slamming my hand on my keybopard and forgetting imidiatly. Durring this activity I learned how sometimes while statements never want to end, for example my prompts kept appearing even after gettting filled out correctly and i had to trouble shoot what was causing the issue. I also learned about calling variables that were already stated into a current funciton.
